This repository consists of  a user-friendly interface that allows individuals to design their own plan for 
emergency shelters and eventually generate their own structure in a 3D space. 

The working interface we created is saved inside the .venv map
For the final interface of the project open interfacefancy.py 
The other py files are tryouts and examples of different options.

First fill in your information, then the render button will come online, 
you can draw you plan and once the render button is hit it will save the centerpoints of the squares in points.csv. 
We use these to create a grid in grashopper rhino
